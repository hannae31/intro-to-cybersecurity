# 1.3.2 - Command Line Interface - Linux

## Lesson Objective(s):
- Demonstrate how to use the command line interface.
- Compare and contrast the difference between using the CLI and GUI.
- Explain how using the CLI could be beneficial if an issue arises that affects normal operation of
their device.

## Guiding Question(s):
- How does understanding how to use a command line interface (CLI) allow
you to continue the use of your device in the event of an issue affecting normal operations?

### Lecture Notes
> From the course notes reviewed in class, take note on the material from this lesson as it relates to the Lesson Objectives and Guiding Question(s):

Virtualization is technology used to allow a computer to have more than one Operatin System (OS) present and operating at the same time on a single piece of hardware. 

A hypervisor is an interface between a virtual machine (VM) and the host machine hardware. Hypervisors are the layer that enables virtualization. 

Advantages of Virtualization

Sandboxing is the separation between software and hardware that creates a barrier to improve security. Optimizes use of expensive hardware such as servers. 

Host - Your physcial computer

Host OS - The operating system running on your physical computer.

Virtual Machine (VM) = Guest Machine OS = the virtual computer with OS running inside a virtualization software. 

Virtualization Software = The sandbox software that provieds an engine for guest virtual machines.

A  virtual machine is JUST like a physical PC in that it has dedicated resources: 
Memory (RAM), Ethernet Connection (NIC), Storage (Hard Disks) 

BUT they need to share with the host PC! 
- If a VM is configures with 2 GB of RAM and 50 GB of Hard Drive space, then these resources are no longer available to the host.

- It is possible to make virtual machines available through a browser by hosting them in a specialized environment with large capacity of resources such as hard drive, memory and internet bandwidth.

- Community colleges and regional cyber ranges across the US provide online access to virtual machines and labs. The Vms are usually connected into virtual Local Area Networks (LAN) like the one in this image.
